# D01 -- Day One.

**The Next Generation of Public Companies is On-Chain**

Onchain incorporation and cap table management platform using compliant security token standards.

---

## The Problem

Today's equity infrastructure is broken. Companies navigate a fragmented maze of intermediaries—lawyers, cap table managers, transfer agents, stock exchanges, and brokers—just to manage ownership.

- **$30-100k/year** wasted on cap table management and compliance
- **7-10 years** before employees see liquidity
- **7% fees** lost to IPO underwriters
- **You don't own your shares**; brokers and custodians do

The system built for the 1970s can't serve the companies of tomorrow.

---

## The Vision

D01 collapses the entire equity stack into a single protocol layer.

Companies incorporate on-chain from Day One. Shareholders have true ownership. Settlement is instant. Corporate actions are programmable. Liquidity is continuous.
