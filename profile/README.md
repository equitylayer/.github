# Day One: the Equity Layer

**Programmable Compliance Infrastructure for Private Markets**

D01 is the infrastructure layer for equity ownership and compliance.

Programmable cap tables, compliance embedded on the share, fundraising, and corporate actions. One protocol serving founders, employees, investors, and broker-dealers from incorporation until IPO.

## The fragmented equity journey

Incorporating, raising funds, issuing options, communicating updates, all live in disconnected platforms, which is a headache for founders, investors and employees alike.

Cap tables diverge across multiple tools and spreadsheets. Every fundraise means weeks of reconciliation. Employees can wait 7-10 years for liquidity events on shares they don't actually hold.

Even larger institutions spend billions on compliance, independently.
- **$190B+/year** spent globally on financial crime compliance, most duplicated across counterparties
- **61-150 days** for KYC onboarding at over half of financial institutions
- **$10-50K** and 4-12 weeks per private securities transfer
- **70% of banks** have lost clients due to slow, inefficient compliance processes

No shared ledger exists for $14.9T AuM in private assets, thus every participant maintains their own version of the record. Clean hand-off for public offerings requires reconciling all of the shares and transfers.

## The Vision

D01 enables a world where equity rights enforce themselves. Where ownership is verifiable, not promised. Where corporate actions execute without reconciliation. Where compliance is embedded in the asset; verified once, trusted by every participant.

One ledger. Every founder, employee, investor, and broker reads the same record.

| Legacy | D01 |
|--------|-----|
| Cap table databases (Carta, Pulley) | On-chain cap table with embedded compliance |
| Transfer agents & law firms | Atomic settlement, programmatic transfer validation |
| Fragmented secondary platforms (Forge, NPM) | Shared compliance rails for any participant |

## Architecture

D01 uses a compliant tokenisation standard ([CMTAT](https://cmta.ch/standards/cmta-token-cmtat)) to model Shares, Options, SAFEs and other instruments, with a proprietary Compliance Layer that codifies and enforces the laws of each jurisdiction.

[ZAMA](https://www.zama.org) is used for onchain privacy, and confidentiality.

Ethereum as our source of truth.

Ownership lives on a public, permissionless ledger that ensures privacy and enforcement rights for the shareholder, compliance abstraction for the distribution parties and a programmable equity toolkit for the operating companies.

## Who It Serves

**Companies** ::: Deploy and manage equity from Day One.

**Shareholders** ::: Real-time holdings, vesting, conversions, one view, on-chain validation.

**Institutions** ::: Broker-dealers, custodians, and investment banks settle on a shared settlement layer.

## Why Now

**Regulatory Clarity**
[SEC clarified](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826-statement-tokenized-securities) that equity tokens integrated into official registers represent true equity ownership. Swiss and Delaware law already support blockchain ledgers. [EU-INC](https://www.eu-inc.org) in the works.

**Scaling & Privacy**
New protocols solved blockchain privacy ([FHE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption#Characteristics)), allowing confidentiality without sacrificing compliance. Transaction costs are close to negligible.

**Market Demand**
Crypto-native founders increasingly want on-chain equity. BlackRock's $2B+ BUIDL fund validates institutional appetite for tokenized assets. The token-vs-equity debate is over.

**Secondary Market Growth**
$210B+ in private secondary volume, growing 30-50% YoY, heading to $400B by 2030. The demand for private securities infrastructure is accelerating ***independently*** of crypto.

## Statement

D01 enables a world where equity rights enforce themselves. Where Ownership is verifiable, not promised. Where corporate actions can execute without intermediaries.

We aim to be the default settlement layer for private securities, serving the interests of all stakeholders during a transaction.
